# TFG-Code
This repository contains the code used for the execution of my final degree project.
- *seurat_integration_human* is the first step and contains the main integration.
- *seurat_src* contains the definition of the different functions used within R Studio.
- *analysis_catt* is the second step, it analyses data and computes clusters and markers.
- *scvelo_analysis_catt* is the third step, velocities are computed and some informative UMAPs are plotted
- *cellrank_cattaneo* is the last step, cell fate is estimated and analysed
